# About this repository

This is a repository contains my second assignment for the ALX-Udacity Data Analyst Track. Which is all about Data Wrangling (Data gathering, assessing and cleaning). In this project, we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
